# end-to-end-churn-prediction-model-with-scikit-learn
An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn (i.e., discontinue the service). This project involves handling real-world data, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and prediction — all powered by Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, MySQL, and SQLAlchemy.

## Project Highlights
✅ Imports data from MySQL database using SQLAlchemy

✅ Performs data cleaning, label encoding, and exploratory data analysis

✅ Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict churn

✅ Evaluates model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

✅ Accepts real-time input for churn prediction using model inference

✅ Stores and reuses LabelEncoders for consistent input preprocessing
